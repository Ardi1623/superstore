## 🔍 Steps of Analysis

### 1. Data Exploration
- Explored key fields: `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Region`, `Sales`, `Discount`, `Profit`, and others.
- Checked data quality and feature types.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- Analyzed total sales by category
- Evaluated average discounts and profits by sub-category and region
- Identified feature correlations (`Sales`, `Profit`, `Discount`, `Quantity`)

### 3. Data Visualization
- Bar charts for sales, discounts, and profit comparison
- Correlation heatmaps
- Regional and sub-category level segmentation

## 📈 Key Insights

### 🔸 Top-Selling Category
- `Technology` is the best-performing category with the highest sales contribution.

### 🔸 High Discounts Don't Guarantee Profit
- Sub-categories such as `Tables` and `Machines` received large discounts but resulted in **negative average profit** in certain regions.
- Discount shows a **negative correlation** with profit.

### 🔸 Region-Based Sub-Category Performance
- Profitability varies by region and sub-category:
  - `Phones` → Highest profit in the West
  - `Copiers` → Strongest in the East
- Marketing and stock strategy should be adjusted per region.

## ❌ Loss-Making Discounts Analysis
Using `Region`, `Category`, and `Sub-Category` combinations:
- Identified products with **high average discounts but negative profits**
- Example findings:
  - Region: South | Sub-Category: Tables | Profit: -185.33 | Discount: 35%
  - Region: East | Sub-Category: Machines | Profit: -92.15 | Discount: 25%
